# Overview

At Flatiron School we focus on teaching the things that are difficult for
people to learn on their own. If you're just getting started though, there's a
wealth of resources scattered around the web to help you out. We've tried to
cherry-pick the best of those resources and organize them into distinct
learning paths that will help you get started on achieving your goals.

Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have
zero prior knowledge on the topic. We make suggestions of how much time to
spend on each section. Try and achieve the learning objectives in the suggested
time frame, then move on. You can always come back and watch the section again.

Some of the resources have quizes/badges attached. If you're already familiar
with a topic, feel free to pass the quiz and move-on. That being said, even we
find ourselves learning new things from the material. 

These paths are designed around breadth over depth. We feel it's important to
get a solid foundation in the broad set of fundamentals within each path before
diving deeper into a specific area. Try to read and watch as much as possible.

# Paths

These Paths are designed to be self-sufficient. Regardless of your experience level, what Path you choose DOES NOT MATTER. Your goal should be to learn to think like a programmer, not learn a specific language. Choose one you're passionate about as the lens through which you will learn, and everything else will fall into place. We promise.

## [Web Development](web-development "Web Development Path Link")

Web Developers create interactive web-based applications. This includes everything but the absolute most simple websites. If your goal is to build awesome things on the web, start here.

## [iOS Development](ios-development "iOS Development Path Link")

iOS is the operating system for iPhones and iPads. Learn how to program the
tiny computer in your pocket by launching a simple to-do list app, and adding features as you learn.
